<p id="a">I think this will be awkward. This is my first website I created.
I think life is full of surprises, I never thought that i would take this AP Computer Science class and create a webpage.
Wanna know me? Its not that easy, I am kinda extrovert and introvert. I can have a fake smile 24/7 for the people
I dont like. I am the youngest in my family, which means, pampered, spoilt brat of the family because my daddy loves me a lot more than my
mommmy. I had not decided my future goal until I thought about being an Engineer. I am a short tempered young lady who might get angry at
small stuff, but then I am also cheerful  and act mature at times.</p>

<p id="a2">My school is great. I used to go to International Indian Public School Riyadh in Saudi Arabia till my sophomore year
    and then shifted to the United States attending Hoffman Estates High School. It is a Great School. They have enough
opportunities any school would have. I am grateful for HEHS to make me what I am today. I have certain memories with
my previous school too, not really with the school, but with my friends I had there. </p>
