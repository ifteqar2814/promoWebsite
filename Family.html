    This is all about my Family. I love my family, i am sure everyone does but my family is the most craziest, weird and
    happy family.</p>  <h1>Father</h1>
<p id="father"> My dad(Iftakhar) is banker and the head of our family. He enjoys working and buying electronics for our house.
hw wakes up early in the morning and does his exercises and has breakfast and leaves for his office. he comes back in evening and we
either go to shopping or stay home and watch T.V. He helps me with my work and sometimes cook for us. My dad lives away from us, he
lives in Riyadh, but does come to visit us every year once. He is a good man and my hero.</p>

<h1>Mother</h1>
<p id="mommy"> My mommy's name is Ayesha Meraj. She is a teacher at Camelot Education. She teachers kids with special needs
 and has a 15 yrs of experience in Vocational Training. She enjoys working with those kids and always want to be surrounding with people.
My mom loves to cook and bake. She usually helps me with my Social Studies work, Science and Computers. My mom loves shopping for clothes
and shoes. She had taught in my previous school as well. She doesn't like me being rude or not eating. She stresses a lot
for a little bit of stuff and wants everyone to be happy. I am sure every mom is important for her kid, but I think my mom is
the best. She is man of our house when Daddy is'nt around.</p>
